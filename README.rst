My personal Ubuntu configuration files. There is no operating system specific
configurations so you could use these in any Linux system.

All my configurations comes under GPL, so use it free, modify as you like.

Currently there is:

+ VIM editor configuration files with some plugins:
    + SnipMate - for PHP, Python, HTML and many more useful snipets.
    + Surround - to surround text with quotes and so on.
    + Bufexplorer - to show full list of opened files, sort them and etc.
    + Vim Outliner - I am using it for GTD mostly.
+ Screen configuration file.
+ Some useful shell aliases (bash).
+ Xterm configuration files (my favorite terminal, with zenburn modified theme).
+ Ubuntu templates (these can be found in Nautilus "Create Document").

If you having Ubuntu configuration files also in repository (github, bitbucket,
launchpad or etc.) please write me. I will be interested to look at them ;)
