My personal Ubuntu configuration files. There is no operating system specific
configurations so you could use these in any Linux system (I hope so).

All my configurations comes under GPL, so use it free, modify as you like.

Currently there is VIM, Screen, Xterm, Mercurial, GIT, Dreampie settings.

If you have any suggestions how to improve this, please write me.
