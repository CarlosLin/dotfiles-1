HOMECONF
========
My personal home folder configuration files. I am currently using Ubuntu Linux
version 10.04, but oldest versions should support these configurations too.

Currently there is:

    * VIM editor configuration files.
    * VIM Outliner configuration files

If you have any comments or suggestions to improve this, please e-mail me:

If you having Ubuntu configuration files also in repository (github, bitbucket,
launchpad or etc.) please write me. I will be interested to look at them ;)
