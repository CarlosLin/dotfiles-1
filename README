HOMECONF
========
My personal home folder configuration files. I am currently using Ubuntu Linux
version 10.04, but there is no OS specific configurations, so you could use it in
any system you like (Linux I mean).

Currently there is:

    * VIM editor configuration files with some plugins:
        * SnipMate - for PHP, Python, HTML and many more useful snipets.
        * Bufexplorer to show full list of opened files, sort them and etc.
    * VIM Outliner configuration files. I am using it for GTD.
    * Screen configuration file.
    * Some useful shell aliases (bash).
    * Xterm configuration files (my favorite terminal, with zenburn modified theme).

If you having Ubuntu configuration files also in repository (github, bitbucket,
launchpad or etc.) please write me. I will be interested to look at them ;)
